# Markdown and VS Code 

Working with Markdown files in Visual Studio Code is simple, straightforward, and fun. Besides VS Code's basic editing, there are a number of Markdown specific features that will help you be more productive.

## Markdown Extentions 
In addition to the functionality VS Code provides out of the box, you can install an extension for greater functionality.

> Tip: Click on an extension tile above to read the description and reviews to decide which extension is best for you. See more in the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com).
